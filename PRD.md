# Release Agent Team - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

Release Agent Team is an autonomous release preparation tool that validates code quality, generates changelogs, updates documentation, and manages the complete release lifecycle for multi-language repositories.

## Problem Statement

Releasing software involves multiple repetitive steps that are easy to forget or execute incorrectly:

- Running tests and linters
- Checking for common issues (local replace directives, untracked files)
- Generating changelogs from commit history
- Updating documentation and badges
- Creating properly formatted commits and tags
- Ensuring CI passes before tagging

Currently, developers must remember and manually execute these steps, leading to inconsistent releases, forgotten changelog updates, and releases that fail CI after tagging.

## Solution

Release Agent automates the entire release workflow:

1. **Validation Phase** - Run all pre-push checks (tests, linting, formatting)
2. **Generation Phase** - Generate changelogs, update roadmaps, refresh badges
3. **Documentation Phase** - Update README, ensure docs reflect changes
4. **Release Phase** - Create commits, push, wait for CI, then tag

## Target Users

- Go developers maintaining open source libraries
- Teams with multi-language monorepos (Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python)
- Developers using Claude Code for AI-assisted development

## User Stories

### US-1: Pre-Push Validation

As a developer, I want to run all quality checks before pushing so that I catch issues before they reach CI.

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Detect languages in repository automatically
- Run language-appropriate checks (build, test, lint, format)
- Report results with clear pass/fail status
- Support configuration via `.releaseagent.yaml`

### US-2: Changelog Generation

As a developer, I want to automatically generate changelogs from my commit history so that I don't have to manually write release notes.

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Integrate with schangelog for commit parsing
- Generate CHANGELOG.md in standard format
- Support conventional commits categorization
- Allow manual override/editing before finalizing

### US-3: README Badge Updates

As a developer, I want my README badges (coverage, version) updated automatically so that documentation stays current.

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Update coverage badge via gocoverbadge
- Update version references in README
- Detect and update other common badges

### US-4: Interactive Mode for Claude Code

As a Claude Code user, I want release-agent to interactively ask me questions when issues arise so that I can make decisions about fixes.

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- `--interactive` flag enables Q&A mode
- Present lint issues with proposed fixes
- Allow user to approve/modify/skip each fix
- Output structured JSON for Claude Code parsing

### US-5: Full Release Workflow

As a developer, I want a single command to handle the entire release so that I don't forget steps.

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- `release-agent-team release v1.2.0` runs complete workflow
- Validates all checks pass before proceeding
- Generates changelog for the release
- Creates release commit with proper message
- Pushes and waits for CI (optional)
- Creates and pushes tag only after CI passes

### US-6: Claude Code Plugin

As a Claude Code user, I want to invoke release-agent via `/release-agent` so that I can use it within my AI workflow.

**Status:** Complete (Custom Plugin via GitHub)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Subagent can ask user questions during execution
- Proper permission handling for file edits
- Clear summary of actions taken
- Install via GitHub: `claude plugin add github:agentplexus/release-agent-team/plugins/claude`

**Note:** Currently available as a custom plugin installed from GitHub. Official Claude Marketplace publication is planned for future release.

### US-7: Multi-Agent Team Architecture

As a developer, I want release validation performed by specialized agents (PM, QA, Docs, Security, Release) so that each concern is handled by a dedicated expert.

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Agents defined using multi-agent-spec format (`team.json`, `deployment.json`)
- DAG workflow with PM running first, parallel validation agents, then Release
- Reports display teams in DAG order (topological sort with alphabetical tie-breaking)
- Canonical IR types from `github.com/agentplexus/multi-agent-spec/sdk/go`
- JSON schema conformance for interoperability

### US-8: Multi-Platform Agent Deployment

As a platform operator, I want agents defined in a portable specification so that I can deploy them to multiple platforms (Claude Code, Kiro CLI, AWS Bedrock).

**Status:** Complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Canonical agent definitions in multi-agent-spec format
- Platform-specific plugins generated from canonical specs
- Support for Claude Code, Kiro CLI, and Gemini CLI
- Deployment spec (`deployment.json`) defines target platforms
