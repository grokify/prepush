# Release Notes - v0.2.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-04

## Overview

This release adds new Go checks, introduces a soft warnings system for non-blocking issues, and fixes a critical bug in directory detection. The README has been expanded with comprehensive git hook setup instructions.

## Highlights

### New Go Checks

Three new checks for Go projects:

| Check | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `go mod tidy` | Hard | Fails if go.mod/go.sum need updating |
| `go build` | Hard | Fails if project doesn't compile |
| untracked refs | Soft | Warns if tracked files reference untracked files |

### Soft Warnings System

New `Warning` field in check results allows checks to report issues without failing the build:

```
=== Summary ===
✓ Go: no local replace directives
✓ Go: mod tidy
✓ Go: build
⚠ Go: untracked references (warning)
  main.go may reference untracked utils.go

Passed: 6, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Warnings: 1

Pre-push checks passed with warnings.
```

Soft checks are useful for:

- Informational checks (coverage reporting)
- Heuristic checks that may have false positives (untracked references)
- Checks you want visibility into but don't want to block on

### Expanded Git Hook Documentation

Three options for setting up prepush as a git hook:

1. **Script**: Create `.git/hooks/pre-push` manually
2. **Symlink**: `ln -sf $(which prepush) .git/hooks/pre-push`
3. **Shared hooks**: Use `.githooks/` directory with `git config core.hooksPath`

## Bug Fixes

### Directory Walking Fix

Fixed a critical bug where prepush would skip the current directory when run with `.` as the target. The issue was that `filepath.WalkDir` returns `.` as the first entry, and the hidden directory check (`name[0] == '.'`) incorrectly matched it.

**Before:** `prepush` in a Go project reported "No supported languages detected"
**After:** Correctly detects Go and runs all checks

## Breaking Changes

None. This release is fully backwards compatible.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/grokify/prepush@v0.2.0
```

## What's Next

Planned for future releases:

- Python checks (pytest, black, ruff)
- Rust checks (cargo build, cargo test, cargo clippy)
- Configuration for soft vs hard check behavior
